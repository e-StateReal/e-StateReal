# Formspree Setup for e-State Real Store

## What is Formspree?

Formspree is a free service that allows you to handle forms on static sites like GitHub Pages. It turns form submissions into emails sent to your configured address.

## Step-by-step Setup

### 1. Create a Formspree Account

1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Create a New Form

1. In the Formspree dashboard, click "New Form"
2. Name it something like "e-State Real Store Forms"
3. Select your email address as the destination
4. Copy the form ID (something like `xpzgwqjq`)

### 3. Update the Code

Replace `xpzgwqjq` in the following files with your real ID:

#### Files to update:

- `assets/js/form-page.js` (line 89)

#### Example change:
```html
<!-- Change this: -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/xpzgwqjq" method="POST">

<!-- To this (with your real ID): -->
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_REAL_ID" method="POST">
```
